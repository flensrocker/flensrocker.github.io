My name is Lars and I'm yet another software developer/architect who wants to write a blog...

My current work includes:

- C/C++ (Win32 desktop applications)
- C# ("classic" .NET Framework with WPF, WCF and "raw" SQL Server)
- C# ("modern" .NET [Core] with Entity Framework Core and AspNet Core)
- TypeScript (Angular frontend)

Things done in the past:

- BASIC and Assembler on the legendary Commodore C64
- PalmOS
- Windows CE (with .NET Compact Framework)

I really would like to write an own blogging engine or Jekyll theme (as we all do),
but to save time I guess I will just stick with what is provided out of the box.
